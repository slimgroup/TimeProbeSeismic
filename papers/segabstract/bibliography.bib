abstract = {Stencil computations are a key part of many high-performance computing applications, such as image processing, convolutional neural networks, and finite-difference solvers for partial differential equations. Devito is a framework capable of generating highly optimized code given symbolic equations expressed in Python, specialized in, but not limited to, affine (stencil) codes. The lowering process—from mathematical equations down to C++ code—is performed by the Devito compiler through a series of intermediate representations. Several performance optimizations are introduced, including advanced common sub-expressions elimination, tiling, and parallelization. Some of these are obtained through well-established stencil optimizers, integrated in the backend of the Devito compiler. The architecture of the Devito compiler, as well as the performance optimizations that are applied when generating code, are presented. The effectiveness of such performance optimizations is demonstrated using operators drawn from seismic imaging applications.},

	abstract = {Least-squares reverse-time migration is a powerful approach for true amplitude seismic imaging of complex geological structures, but the successful application of this method is currently hindered by its enormous computational cost, as well as high memory requirements for computing the gradient of the objective function. We tackle these problems by introducing an algorithm for low-cost sparsity-promoting least-squares migration using on-the-fly Fourier transforms. We formulate the least-squares migration objective function in the frequency domain and compute gradients for randomized subsets of shot records and frequencies, thus significantly reducing data movement and the number of overall wave equations solves. By using on-the-fly Fourier transforms, we can compute an arbitrary number of monochromatic frequency-domain wavefields with a time-domain modeling code, instead of having to solve individual Helmholtz equations for each frequency, which quickly becomes computationally infeasible when moving to high frequencies. Our numerical examples demonstrate that compressive imaging with on-the-fly Fourier transforms provides a fast and memory-efficient alternative to time-domain imaging with optimal checkpointing, whose memory requirements for a fixed background model and source wavelet is independent of the number of time steps. Instead, memory and additional computational cost grow with the number of frequencies and determine the amount of subsampling artifacts and crosstalk. In contrast to optimal checkpointing, this offers the possibility to trade both memory and computational cost for image quality or a larger number of iterations and is advantageous in new computing environments such as the cloud, where compute is often cheaper than memory and data movement.},

	abstract = {Image gathers as a function of subsurface offset are an important tool for the inference of rock properties and velocity analysis in areas of complex geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of as multidimensional correlations of the source and receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing these gathers lies in the fact that one needs to store, compute, and correlate these wavefields for all shots in order to obtain the desired image gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically only computed for a limited number of subsurface points and for a limited range of subsurface offsets, which may cause problems in complex geological areas with large geologic dips. We overcome increasing computational and storage costs of extended image volumes by introducing a formulation that avoids explicit storage and removes the customary and expensive loop over shots found in conventional extended imaging. As a result, we end up with a matrix{\textendash}vector formulation from which different image gathers can be formed and with which amplitude-versus-angle and wave-equation migration velocity analysis can be performed without requiring prior information on the geologic dips. Aside from demonstrating the formation of two-way extended image gathers for different purposes and at greatly reduced costs, we also present a new approach to conduct automatic wave-equation-based migration-velocity analysis. Instead of focusing in particular offset directions and preselected subsets of subsurface points, our method focuses every subsurface point for all subsurface offset directions using a randomized probing technique. As a consequence, we obtain good velocity models at low cost for complex models without the need to provide information on the geologic dips.},

The data-averaging approach is only viable, however, for a least-squares misfit, which is sensitive to outliers in the data and artifacts unexplained by the forward model. This motivates us to propose a robust formulation based on the Student{\textquoteright}s t-distribution of the error.

	abstract = {Subsurface-offset gathers play an increasingly important role in seismic imaging. These gathers are used during velocity model building and inversion of rock properties from amplitude variations. While powerful, these gathers come with high computational and storage demands to form and manipulate these high dimensional objects. This explains why only limited numbers of image gathers are computed over a limited offset range. We avoid these high costs by working with highly compressed low-rank factorizations. We arrive at these factorizations via a combination of probings with the double two-way wave equation and randomized singular value decompositions. In turn, the resulting factorizations give us access to all subsurface offsets without having to form the full extended image volumes. The latter is computationally prohibitive because extended image volumes are quadratic in image size. As a result, we can easily handle situations where conventional horizontal offset gathers are no longer focused. More importantly, the factorization also provides a mechanism to use the invariance relation of extended image volumes for velocity continuation. With this technique, extended image volumes for one background velocity model can directly be mapped to those of another background velocity model. Our low-rank factorization inherits this invariance property so we incur factorization costs only once when examining different imaging scenarios. Because all imaging experiments only involve the factors, they are computationally cheap with costs that scale with the rank of the factorization. We validate our methodology on 2D synthetics including a challenging imaging example with salt. Our experiments show that our low-rank factorization parameterizes extended image volumes naturally. Instead of brute force explicit cross-correlations between shifted source and receiver wavefields, our approach relies on the underlying linear-algebra structure that enables us to work with these objects without incurring unfeasible demands on computation and storage.},

The crosscorrelation condition requires both fields to be available at the same time instants. For large-scale 3D problems, it is not possible, in practice, to store snapshots of the wavefields during forward modeling due to extreme storage requirements. We have developed an approximate wavefield reconstruction method that uses particle velocity field recordings on the boundaries to reconstruct the forward wavefields during the computation of the reverse time wavefields. The method is computationally effective and requires less storage than similar methods. We have compared the reconstruction method to a boundary reconstruction method that uses particle velocity and stress fields at the boundaries and to the optimal checkpointing method. We have tested the methods on a 2D vertical transversely isotropic model and a large-scale 3D elastic FWI problem. Our results revealed that there are small differences in the results for the three methods.},

	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion can be formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem. This non-convex problem can be extremely computationally expensive because it requires repeatedly solving large linear systems that correspond to discretized partial differential equations. Randomized subsampling techniques allow us to work with small subsets of (monochromatic) source experiments, reducing the computational cost. However, this subsampling weakens subsurface illumination and introduces subsampling related incoherent artifacts. These subsampling-related artifacts{\textendash}-in conjunction with local minima that are known to plague full-waveform inversion{\textendash}-motivate us to come up with a technique to "regularize" this problem. Following earlier work, we take advantage of the fact that curvelets represent subsurface models and perturbations parsimoniously. At first impulse promoting sparsity on the model directly seems the most natural way to proceed, but we will demonstrate that in certain cases it can be advantageous to promote sparsity on the Gauss-Newton updates instead. While constraining the one-norm of the descent directions does not change not change the underlying full-waveform inversion objective, the constrained model updates remain descent directions, remove subsampling-related artifacts and improve the overall inversion result. We empirically observe this phenomenon in situations where the different model updates occur at roughly the same locations in the curvelet domain. We further investigate and analyze this phenomenon, where nonlinear inversions benefit from sparsity-promoting constraints on the updates, by means of a set of carefully selected examples including phase retrieval and full-waveform inversion. In all cases, we observe a faster decay of the residual and model error as a function of the number of iterations.},

    abstract = { Reverse-time migration (RTM) exhibits great superiority over other imaging algorithms in handling steeply dipping structures and complicated velocity models. However, low-frequency, high-amplitude noises commonly seen in a typical RTM image have been one of the major concerns because they can seriously contaminate the signals in the image if they are not handled properly. We propose a new imaging condition to effectively and efficiently eliminate these specific noises from the image. The method works by first decomposing the source and receiver wavefields to their one-way propagation components, followed by applying a correlation-based imaging condition to the appropriate combinations of the decomposed wavefields. We first give the physical explanation of the principle of such noises in the conventional RTM image. Then we provide the detailed mathematical theory for the new imaging condition. Finally, we propose an efficient scheme for its numerical implementation. It replaces the computationally intensive decomposition with the cost-effective Hilbert transform, which significantly improves the efficiency of the imaging condition. Applications to various synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that this new imaging condition can effectively remove the undesired low-frequency noises in the image. }

    abstract = { Reverse time migration (RTM) is achieved by a forward and reverse time propagation of source and receiver wavefields respectively, followed by an imaging condition. The quality of the image from any RTM implementation depends directly on the method's ability to separate the true reflection data from the backscattered correlation noise between the source and receiver wavefields. In this paper we demonstrate the application of an inverse scattering imaging condition that significantly reduces this backscattered correlation noise and results in a much higher quality subsurface image than is achieved by typical RTM imaging conditions. }

abstract = {We analyze the convergence of randomized trace estimators. Starting at 1989, several algorithms have been proposed for estimating the trace of a matrix by 1/MΣi=1M ziT Azi, where the zi are random vectors; different estimators use different distributions for the zis, all of which lead to E(1/MΣi=1M ziT Azi) = trace(A). These algorithms are useful in applications in which there is no explicit representation of A but rather an efficient method compute zTAz given z. Existing results only analyze the variance of the different estimators. In contrast, we analyze the number of samples M required to guarantee that with probability at least 1-δ, the relative error in the estimate is at most ϵ. We argue that such bounds are much more useful in applications than the variance. We found that these bounds rank the estimators differently than the variance; this suggests that minimum-variance estimators may not be the best.We also make two additional contributions to this area. The first is a specialized bound for projection matrices, whose trace (rank) needs to be computed in electronic structure calculations. The second is a new estimator that uses less randomness than all the existing estimators.},
