abstract = {Stencil computations are a key part of many high-performance computing applications, such as image processing, convolutional neural networks, and finite-difference solvers for partial differential equations. Devito is a framework capable of generating highly optimized code given symbolic equations expressed in Python, specialized in, but not limited to, affine (stencil) codes. The lowering process—from mathematical equations down to C++ code—is performed by the Devito compiler through a series of intermediate representations. Several performance optimizations are introduced, including advanced common sub-expressions elimination, tiling, and parallelization. Some of these are obtained through well-established stencil optimizers, integrated in the backend of the Devito compiler. The architecture of the Devito compiler, as well as the performance optimizations that are applied when generating code, are presented. The effectiveness of such performance optimizations is demonstrated using operators drawn from seismic imaging applications.},

While there is an extensive and growing literature on the topic, publications focus mostly on technical aspects, making this topic inaccessible for a broader audience due to the lack of simple introductory resources for newcomers to geophysics. We will accomplish this by providing a hands-on walkthrough of FWI using Devito (Lange et al. 2016), a system based on domain-specific languages that automatically generates code for time-domainfinite-differences.},

Devito allows us to define wave equations as symbolic Python expressions (Meurer et al., 2017), from which optimized FD stencil code is automatically generated at run time. In part 1, we show how we can use Devito to set up and solve acoustic wave equations with (impulsive) seismic sources and sample wavefields at the receiver locations to model shot records.},

	abstract = {Least-squares reverse-time migration is a powerful approach for true amplitude seismic imaging of complex geological structures, but the successful application of this method is currently hindered by its enormous computational cost, as well as high memory requirements for computing the gradient of the objective function. We tackle these problems by introducing an algorithm for low-cost sparsity-promoting least-squares migration using on-the-fly Fourier transforms. We formulate the least-squares migration objective function in the frequency domain and compute gradients for randomized subsets of shot records and frequencies, thus significantly reducing data movement and the number of overall wave equations solves. By using on-the-fly Fourier transforms, we can compute an arbitrary number of monochromatic frequency-domain wavefields with a time-domain modeling code, instead of having to solve individual Helmholtz equations for each frequency, which quickly becomes computationally infeasible when moving to high frequencies. Our numerical examples demonstrate that compressive imaging with on-the-fly Fourier transforms provides a fast and memory-efficient alternative to time-domain imaging with optimal checkpointing, whose memory requirements for a fixed background model and source wavelet is independent of the number of time steps. Instead, memory and additional computational cost grow with the number of frequencies and determine the amount of subsampling artifacts and crosstalk. In contrast to optimal checkpointing, this offers the possibility to trade both memory and computational cost for image quality or a larger number of iterations and is advantageous in new computing environments such as the cloud, where compute is often cheaper than memory and data movement.},
